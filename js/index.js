Inspired by the design of Louis Voitton & Nike's Air Force we developed a web application where you can register (requiring you to access your email to confirm your registration), login, select and purchase any pair of shoes that the page have in stock. You can also customize a random generated avatar to fit your personality and the admin account can loan, re-stock, disable or re-enable products. SkyWalkies was the last project that we did for MindHub LA. They asked us to make an e-commerce from scratch in one week and then make an exposition of the site selling it as a product.",
